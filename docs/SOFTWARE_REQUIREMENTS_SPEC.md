## Project title and authors

Sokoban by Greg Gorlen, Severin Light, Juan Rangel Espinoza, Irvin Tancioco 

## Overview

Our proposal is to create an implementation of the puzzle game [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) in C++ that will be compiled to [WASM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly) with [Emscripten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emscripten) to power a HTML5/JS/CSS user interface (UI).

## Goals and Purpose

Our web-based Sokoban game will have greater user reachability compared to a more esoteric interface like the console or SDL2. The game will have both entertainment and educational value for developing logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. It should appeal to a wide audience who might only have a browser and Internet access.
