Sokoban by Greg Gorlen, Irvin Tancioco

## Overview

Our proposal is to create an implementation of the puzzle game [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) in C++ that will be compiled to [WASM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly) with [Emscripten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emscripten) to power a HTML5/JS/CSS user interface (UI).
