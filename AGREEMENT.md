# Agreement

### Questions to answer

- How often will you be actively working on the project and communicating with the team?
- Which tasks do you commit to work on? (we can flesh this out further once we have a project chosen)
- What are your commitments for avoiding and resolving conflict?

### Greg's agreement

I, Greg, will be actively working on the project for at least 2 days a week, 4-5 hours a day. I agree to check in with Discord every other day at minimum. I will listen to, ask for, and respect all viewpoints and opinions and do my best to take everyone's needs into consideration and make the project as educational and fun as possible.

If conflict arises, I will take an active role in resolving it by being solution-oriented and avoiding any personal remarks or passive-aggressive or controlling behavior.

I will welcome any positive or critical feedback.

I plan to take an active role in contributing to all areas of the project and will ensure the final result is delivered on time and all goals, sprints and milestones are met.

Only a serious, unforseen life adjustment should prevent me from fulfilling these goals.
